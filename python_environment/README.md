# README
The current readme file briefly explains the provided python environment.
The python notebook "ddsp_synthesize_midi_clean.ipynb" is based on the publication of *L. Renault et al. [DIFFERENTIABLE PIANO MODEL FOR MIDI-TO-AUDIO PERFORMANCE SYNTHESIS](https://dafx2020.mdw.ac.at/proceedings/papers/DAFx20in22_paper_48.pdf)*  \
The whole synthesizer model is available on the [github repo](https://github.com/lrenault/ddsp-piano) of *L. Renault et al.*. 

We provide an ipython notebook for easy access with multiple modification functions. 
Furthermore, helper functions are provided in "ADP_utils.py". Additional functions for plots are provided in "ADP_plots.py". 
As we had to make modifications a modified "piano_model.py" and "sub_models.py" file is added which have to be exchanged when using our functions. 
The provided function are all based on the version v0.1.0 which can be found under tags on the original github repo.
