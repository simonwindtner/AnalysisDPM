# README
The current readme file shortly explains the provided python environment.
First of all the function relys on the publication of *L. Renault et al.* and can be fully discovered in his [github repo](https://github.com/lrenault/ddsp-piano).

We provide a ipython notebook for easy access with multiply modifications functions. 
Furthermore, helper functions are provided in "ADP_utils.py". Additional functions for plots are provided in "ADP_plots.py". 
As we had to make modifications a modified "piano_modle.py" and "sub_models.py" file is added which have to be exchanged when using our functions. 
The provided function are all based on the version v0.1.0 which can be found under tags on the original github repo.
